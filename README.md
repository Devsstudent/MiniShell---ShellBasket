# Minishell Project of 42 school

### Goals
* This project is about reproducing the shell functionnality using systemcall execve to execute binary commands
* We had to build our own shell handling: 
	* Redirections
	* Pipes
	* Here-Doc
	* Error status code
* In the bonus part we handle:
	* Parentheses priority
	* Wildcard
* It's a command line reproduction but just a basic one
